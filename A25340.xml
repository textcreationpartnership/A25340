            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Ancient Manufacture of White Saltmaking at <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Northſhields, Sunderland</hi> and <hi>Blyth,</hi> ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and encouraged, for the enſuing Reaſons moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſented.</head>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That in the time of Hoſtility with <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1627, 28, 29, 30, there was ſuch a ſcarcity of Salt in this Nation, that it was ſold at extream rates, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 s. <hi>per</hi> Buſhell, and upwards, and in many places in <hi>England</hi> not to be had for any mony.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Peace was concluded beween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> made an Edict, that no Salt ſhould be exported out of his Kingdom, upon confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ship, Goods, and Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Peace being concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> divers Merchants of <hi>England</hi> ſent between 2 and 300 ſail of Ships to <hi>Spaine,</hi> to fetch Salt for the ſupply of this Nation, And the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> taking notice of <hi>Englands</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof, did not only a long time imbarge the ſaid Ships; but did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately impoſe upon his Salt ſuch a great Impoſition, that it came to the double value of the Salt there uſually ſold: whereby the Merchants loſt many 1000 l.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By making Salt of Sea-water there's great quantities of courſe Coles ſpent there, which are the refuſe of their beſt Coal-mines, and fit for no other u<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and ſo the Owners of them ſelling them for that uſe, are the better enabled to go through with their Cole-mines, in preventing mixture of thoſe bad with good, which otherwiſe would be to the great annoyance of the whole Commonwealth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſidering the great charge, coſt and pains beſtowed and disburſed before that Manufacture could be brought to perfection; as firſt, out of a waſte and roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie piece of ground adjoyning upon the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> in taking up the ſaid rocks and ſtones, and in building Wharfs and Staiths along the ſaid River, and after in placing Salt-pans thereupon; the removing of which rocks hath made the River there abouts far better navigable than before, though with great charge to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After the Salt-pans were erected, the late Deane and Chapter compelled your Petitioners the Salt-makers, to take Leaſes of them for the ſaid Wharfs and Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pans and forced them to pay an annuall rent for the ſame, and every ſeven years to renew their Leaſe, or otherwiſe to pay a great ſumme if they continued them lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which brought a great charge upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the time of theſe late diſtractions and wars their Salt-works were deſtroyed and ruinated by the Kings Forces and the <hi>Scots,</hi> the re-building whereof hath coſt them many 1000 l.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since the repairing and re-building thereof, they have been lately compelled to purchaſe them of the Commonwealth, whereby moſt of their Eſtates are engaged, and likely to be the overthrow of them and their Families, who hath ſpent their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in bringing ſuch a Native and good Manufacture to perfection, which is able (if encouraged) to ſupply the whole Nation of <hi>England</hi> with Salt ſufficient for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving both Fiſh, Fleſh, and other Victuals, without dependance upon any forreign State whatſoever, and then he it war or peace, ſcarcity or plenty, this Commonwealth may be ſupplyed with a ſufficiency of good Salt, and at moderate prices.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If this Manufacture be not encouraged, it will tend to the deſtruction of many Thouſands of poor People in thoſe places whoſe dependancy is wholly upon the ſaid Salt-works, who eat their daily Bread by their dayly Labour in that Manufacture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is humbly prayed, That for theſe Reaſons the Petition of the Salt-markers of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Southſhields, Sunderland</hi> and <hi>Blyth,</hi> depending in the hands of a Member of Parliament, may be taken into ſpeedy conſideration.</hi>
